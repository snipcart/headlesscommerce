# Headless & coupled e-commerce solutions (Tailwind & Vue app)

## Context

Snipcart was a sponsor at [Headless Commerce Summit](https://headlesscommercesummit.com/), an event organized by Netlify. Our CEO François gave a lightning talk titled [Does Snipcart have a head?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WB8OXZnH4k)

For this talk, we needed a way to better visualize differences between headless & coupled e-commerce solutions. We had wanted to experiment with Vue + Tailwind CSS for a while, so we did.

[Here's the resulting app!](https://headlesscommerce.netlify.app/)

The headless e-commerce solutions featured in the app are placed in 4 categories, depending on their characteristics:

- Monolithic
- Add-on
- Storefront
- API

## Contributing

You can submit edits or other solutions by cloning the repo and opening a PR.

We hope this app helps developers and merchants better understand the place of each of these e-commerce tools in the ecosystem.

## Tailwind + Vue tutorial

We wrote a blog post to show how to set up Tailwind in a Vue.js app. Here's what it covers:

- Generating a Vue 3 app
- Setting up Tailwind CSS
- Defining data to play with Tailwind
- Pushing the configuration further
